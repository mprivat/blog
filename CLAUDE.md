# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a simple blog repository containing static HTML content. The repository consists of:
- A single HTML file (`magic.html`) containing a blog post about software engineering craft
- A minimal README.md file

## Architecture

This is a static content repository with no build system, dependencies, or complex architecture:
- **Content**: Single HTML page with inline CSS styling
- **Styling**: Inline styles for simplicity (centered layout, sans-serif font, responsive design)
- **Structure**: Self-contained HTML document with no external dependencies

## Development

Since this is a static HTML blog with no build process:
- **Viewing**: Open `magic.html` directly in a web browser
- **Editing**: Modify HTML files directly - no compilation or build step required
- **Testing**: Manual testing by opening files in browsers

The HTML follows basic semantic structure with proper meta tags and responsive design principles through inline CSS.
