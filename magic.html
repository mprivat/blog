  <h1>The Software Engineers Who Make Magic</h1>
  <p><em>by Michael Privat</em></p>

  <p>I’m an executive who build high-performance software engineering teams for a living. There’s a lot of talk about vibe coding out there and lots of emphasis on the AI. Let’s talk about the humans for a minute or two.

This is an article I originally wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/software-engineers-who-make-magic-love-letter-craft-michael-privat-rqyxf">here</a>.

I've met many software engineers in my career. Most are capable. Many are competent. But a rare few—they're something else entirely. They're the ones I'm always searching for.

You know who you are.

You're the engineer who stays up until 3 AM not because a deadline looms, but because you can't stop thinking about that elegant solution just beyond your grasp. The one who feels physical discomfort when leaving technical debt unaddressed, like a detective with an unsolved case.

You don't just "learn" new technologies—you devour them, taking them apart to understand how they're put together. You're equally fascinated by the beauty in both arcane algorithms and clean interfaces. You recognize that the code nobody sees deserves the same craftsmanship as the parts everyone praises.

While others celebrate shipping features, you find deeper satisfaction in knowing your implementation will withstand the chaos of production for years to come. Your tests aren't written to appease processes—they're love letters to your future self and anyone brave enough to iterate on your work.

You've felt that unique frustration of inheriting a codebase where every corner was cut, where every quick fix created three new problems, where documentation was an afterthought. And you've sworn never to inflict that experience on another soul.

The engineers I want on my team don't measure progress by tickets closed but by systems simplified. They automate not just to save time but because they respect human creativity too much to waste it on repetitive tasks. They craft documentation not from obligation but because they understand knowledge unshared is knowledge wasted.

These engineers don't hide behind complexity—they battle it relentlessly. They don't wait for permission to make things better. They see problems that others accept as "just how things are" and refuse to walk past them.

If you've ever refactored code that "worked fine" because its design offended your sensibilities, I want to know you.

If you've ever built tools to make your whole team more effective rather than just optimizing your own workflow, you belong here.

If you've found yourself explaining technical concepts at a dinner party because you simply can't contain your enthusiasm for elegant solutions, we should talk.

The corporate world is filled with engineers who do what they're told. I'm looking for the ones who do what needs to be done. Those who see engineering not as a job but as a craft worthy of mastery. Those who recognize that extraordinary work isn't about following every rule but about delivering solutions so good that they change the rules.

Is this you? If reading this made your heart beat a little faster because someone finally put words to how you approach your craft—let's connect. The world needs more engineers who care this deeply, and I'm building teams where you'll be surrounded by others who share your passion.

Because when people who truly love the craft work together, magic happens.</p>
